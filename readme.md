# Total War Troy Mod: Respec Button

This is a mod that adds a single button to the character UI to fully respec the character's skills, heroes and agents. This can be done multiple times, but each subsequent respec will cost you twice as much gold. It is a direct port of [One Button Respec](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1588424293) warhammer 2 mod from **Drunk Flamingo** and **Sm0kin**.

Base respec cost is set to 10 gold per each level (meaning an agent or hero at lvl 10 will cost you 100 gold for the first respec). Then, this base cost is doubled each time you respec the character.

This is a just a script mode, so it should be compatible with everything and should be save compatible.

Will probably have the option to adjust the respec cost or allow a one-time respec for free like in the original mod, once the Modding Configuration Tool is ported over Troy if it ever happens. If not, the mod will probably allow you do that through some configuration files.

Huge thanks to Drunk Flamingo and Sm0kin for the original mod authored for Warrhammer 2 upon which this mod is based off.
